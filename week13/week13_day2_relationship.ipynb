    "When you import data into Power BI, you often have multiple tables instead of one big table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customers (info about people buying)\n",
    "\n",
    "Orders (info about purchases)\n",
    "\n",
    "Products (info about items sold)\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 To analyze across them (like \"Which customer bought which product?\"), Power BI needs to know how those tables are related.\n",
    "That’s what relationships do.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 Types of Relationships\n",
    "1. One-to-One (1:1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Each record in Table A matches exactly one record in Table B.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "EmployeeDetails table (one row per employee)\n",
    "\n",
    "EmployeeAddress table (also one row per employee)\n",
    "\n",
    "EmployeeID in both → 1:1.\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 Why use it? Rare in reporting, but useful when you split a big table into two for storage or security.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. One-to-Many (1:*) ⭐ (Most common in Power BI)\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: One record in Table A can link to many records in Table B.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "One Customer can have many Orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "One Product can appear in many Sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "Power BI calls the “one” side the dimension table and the “many” side the fact table.\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 Why use it?\n",
    "Because this is the natural way business data works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Customers → Orders\n",
    "\n",
    "Products → Sales\n",
    "\n",
    "Dates → Transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "It lets you slice/aggregate correctly:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you put Customer Name and Sales Amount in a report, Power BI uses the relationship to “look up” all orders belonging to that customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Many-to-Many (:)\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Many records in Table A can link to many records in Table B.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "A Salesperson can cover multiple Regions,\n",
    "\n",
    "And each Region can have multiple Salespeople.\n",
    "\n",
    "Direct many-to-many creates ambiguity because Power BI can’t tell which row belongs where without a bridge table.\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 Why use it?\n",
    "Needed when both sides repeat. Usually fixed by:\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding a lookup/bridge table (e.g., SalespersonRegion)\n",
    "\n",
    "Converting into two 1:many relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 Why Relationships Matter in Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Without proper relationships:\n",
    "\n",
    "Your measures (SUM, COUNT, etc.) return wrong totals.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can’t “drill down” or filter across tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might see duplicated or missing rows in visuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "If Customers ↔ Orders isn’t linked correctly, a report like “Sales per Customer” won’t work.\n",
    "\n",
    "If Products ↔ Sales is many-to-many by mistake, totals may double-count.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Think of relationships like the \"map\" Power BI uses to travel between tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "1:many → the “normal road”\n",
    "\n",
    "many:many → a messy road, you fix with a bridge\n",
    "\n",
    "1:1 → a special road, rarely used"
