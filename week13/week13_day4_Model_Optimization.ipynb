    "# üîó Power BI Relationships Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relationships define how tables are connected and how filters flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are two main aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Cardinality (type of relationship)\n",
    " - Cross-filter direction (single vs both)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Relationship Cardinality (Types)\n",
    "\n",
    "a) One-to-Many (1:*) ‚Äî Most Common\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Date table ‚Üí Sales table\n",
    "One date (e.g., 01-Jan-2017) ‚Üí Many sales transactions for that date.\n",
    "‚úÖ Works perfectly for fact (transaction) and dimension (lookup) tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Many-to-One (:1) ‚Äî Same as 1:\n",
    "Just the reverse direction of above.\n",
    "Example: Sales table ‚Üí Product table (many sales per one product).\n",
    "‚ö†Ô∏è Usually Power BI will auto-detect and flip it to 1:*.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) One-to-One (1:1)\n",
    "Each row in one table matches exactly one row in the other.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Employee Table (EmployeeID) ‚Üî EmployeeDetails Table (EmployeeID)\n",
    "Useful when you split a wide table into two.\n",
    "‚ö†Ô∏è Rare in reporting models.\n",
    "\n",
    "d) Many-to-Many (:)\n",
    "Both sides can have duplicates.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Students table\n",
    "Courses table\n",
    "One student can enroll in many courses, and each course can have many students.\n",
    "In Power BI, a bridge table (like Enrollment) is usually created.\n",
    "‚ö†Ô∏è Can lead to ambiguity if not modeled carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Cross-Filter Direction (Single vs Both)\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Single Direction (‚Üí)\n",
    "Filter flows from the lookup (dimension) table to the fact table.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Product[Category] ‚Üí Sales[ProductKey]\n",
    "If you filter ‚ÄúCategory = Bikes‚Äù, it limits Sales rows to only Bikes.\n",
    "‚úÖ Default and safest.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Both (‚Üî) [Bidirectional]\n",
    "Filters flow both ways.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Sales ‚Üî Product\n",
    "Filtering Products filters Sales (normal).\n",
    "Filtering Sales also restricts Products (e.g., show only products that have sales).\n",
    "‚ö†Ô∏è Risks:\n",
    "Ambiguous paths if multiple relationships exist.\n",
    "Can give wrong totals if used unnecessarily.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Best used in:\n",
    "Many-to-many scenarios (e.g., Students ‚Üî Courses).\n",
    "Dynamic security (row-level security rules).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Active vs Inactive Relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "Active relationship: solid line ‚Üí used by default in DAX.\n",
    "Inactive relationship: dashed line ‚Üí ignored unless activated with USERELATIONSHIP() in DAX.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Sales has two dates: OrderDate and ShipDate.\n",
    "You can relate both to the Date table, but only one can be active.\n",
    "To use the inactive one:"
