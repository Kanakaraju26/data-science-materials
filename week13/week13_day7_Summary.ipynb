    "# ðŸ“Š Week 3 Progress: Power BI Data Modeling + HR Analytics\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ”¹ Day 1 â€“ Learn Star Schema\n",
    "- Studied **Star Schema** concepts:\n",
    "  - **Fact tables** â†’ contain measurable events (e.g., Sales, Attendance, Attrition).\n",
    "  - **Dimension tables** â†’ describe entities (e.g., Employees, Departments, Products, Date).\n",
    "- Sketched schemas for:\n",
    "  - **E-commerce dataset** â†’ Fact: Orders, Sales; Dimensions: Customers, Products, Date.\n",
    "  - **HR dataset** â†’ Fact: Attendance/Attrition; Dimensions: Employees, Department, Date.\n",
    "- Key takeaway: **Separate facts & dimensions** â†’ makes analysis scalable and efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ”¹ Day 2 â€“ Relationships in Power BI\n",
    "- Practiced creating **1:many** and **many:many** relationships.\n",
    "- Used **surrogate keys** (like EmployeeID, DepartmentID) for joining tables.\n",
    "- Explored the **Manage Relationships** pane.\n",
    "- Understood **filter direction** in relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ”¹ Day 3 â€“ Build Your Own Date Table\n",
    "- Created **Date Table** using:\n",
    "  - **Power Query (M)** â†’ `List.Dates()` function.\n",
    "  - **DAX** â†’ `CALENDAR(MIN(Date), MAX(Date))`.\n",
    "- Added calculated columns:\n",
    "  - `Year`, `Quarter`, `Month`, `Week`, `FiscalYear`.\n",
    "- Marked the table as a **Date Table** in Power BI.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ”¹ Day 4 â€“ Model Optimization\n",
    "- Optimized data model:\n",
    "  - **Hid unused columns** to simplify schema.\n",
    "  - Differentiated between **calculated columns vs measures**.\n",
    "  - Explored **bidirectional relationships** and their risks (filter propagation loops).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ”¹ Day 5 â€“ Mini-Project: HR Analytics\n",
    "- Built a small HR data model:\n",
    "  - Tables: **Employee, Department, Attendance**.\n",
    "  - Added a custom **Date Table**.\n",
    "  - Modeled relationships â†’ EmployeeID â†” DepartmentID, EmployeeID â†” Attendance.\n",
    "- Created a **fact/dimension schema** for HR analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ”¹ Day 6 â€“ Dashboard + Insights\n",
    "- Built HR Dashboard with KPIs:\n",
    "  1. **Attrition Rate**\n",
    "     ```DAX\n",
    "     Attrition Rate = \n",
    "     DIVIDE(\n",
    "         COUNTROWS(FILTER(Employee, Employee[Attrition] = \"Yes\")),\n",
    "         COUNTROWS(Employee)\n",
    "     )\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "  2. **Average Tenure**\n",
    "     ```DAX\n",
    "     Avg Tenure = AVERAGE(Employee[YearsAtCompany])\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "  3. **Department Turnover**\n",
    "     ```DAX\n",
    "     Dept Turnover = \n",
    "     DIVIDE(\n",
    "         COUNTROWS(FILTER(Employee, Employee[Attrition] = \"Yes\")),\n",
    "         COUNTROWS(Employee)\n",
    "     )\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "- Designed visuals:\n",
    "  - **KPI Cards** â†’ Attrition Rate, Avg Tenure.\n",
    "  - **Bar Chart** â†’ Turnover % by Department.\n",
    "- Explored KPI visual fields:\n",
    "  - **Value** = metric (e.g., Attrition Rate).\n",
    "  - **Trend Axis** = usually Date (not available in IBM dataset, can simulate).\n",
    "  - **Target** = benchmark (e.g., 10% Attrition).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ”¹ Day 7 â€“ Deliverable\n",
    "- Packaged:\n",
    "  - **Power BI model + dashboard**.\n",
    "  - **Documentation (this log)**.\n",
    "- Published project to **GitHub** ðŸŽ‰\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## âœ… Key Learnings This Week\n",
    "- Importance of **Star Schema** in BI modeling.\n",
    "- How **relationships + DAX** combine to generate insights.\n",
    "- Created custom **Date Table** for time intelligence.\n",
    "- Built a working **HR Analytics Dashboard** with KPIs.\n"
