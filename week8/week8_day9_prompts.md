## 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Act as a Python expert for data cleaning. Given the following Pandas DataFrame structure and a sample of the 
'customer_id', 
'purchase_date', 
'price' columns, 
provide Python code to:
 Identify and handle missing values (e.g., fill with median for 'price', drop rows for 'customer_id'). 
 Convert 'purchase_date' to datetime objects.
 Detect and cap outliers in 'price' using the IQR method.
Include comments explaining each step.
DataFrame sample:


## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
I have a dataset on e-commerce transactions with columns like 
'product_category', 
'amount_spent', 
'customer_segment', 
'transaction_date'. 
Propose 5 key exploratory data analysis questions to understand customer purchasing behavior. For each question, suggest relevant columns to analyze and appropriate Python libraries (e.g., Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) and methods to use, along with a brief explanation of what the analysis would reveal. 

## 3. Feature Engineering

Given a dataset containing customer demographic information (age, gender, location) and their online activity (pages visited, time spent on site, number of clicks), suggest 3-5 new features that could be engineered to improve a customer churn prediction model. For each suggested feature, explain its potential relevance and provide a conceptual approach for its calculation.

## 4. Model Selection and Justification

I'm working on a binary classification problem to predict customer churn. I have a dataset with both numerical and categorical features. Explain the pros and cons of using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost) for this task. Which model would you initially recommend and why, considering interpretability, performance, and handling of different data types?

## 5. Code Generation and Debugging

Write a Python function using Scikit-learn that performs the following steps:

1. Splits a given DataFrame into training and testing sets (80/20 split, stratify by target variable 'churn').

2. Trains a RandomForestClassifier on the training data.

3. Evaluates the model on the test set and prints the classification report and confusion matrix.

Assume the target variable is named 'churn' and the features are all other columns. Include error handling for missing target column.

## 6. Explaining Complex Concepts

Explain the concept of "Regularization" in machine learning, specifically L1 and L2 regularization, to a non-technical audience (e.g., a business stakeholder). Use analogies to make it easy to understand and highlight why it's important for model performance and avoiding overfitting.

## 7. Data Visualization

I have sales data over the past year, with columns 'date', 'product_category', and 'sales_amount'.

1. Suggest the most suitable chart types to visualize:

    a. Monthly sales trends.

    b. Sales distribution across product categories.

    c. How sales of a specific product category change over time.

2. For each, describe what insights can be gained from that visualization.

## 8. Statistical Analysis and Hypothesis Testing

I've conducted an A/B test for a new website design. Group A (control) saw 10% conversion rate, and Group B (new design) saw 12% conversion rate, with 1000 users in each group. Explain how I can perform a hypothesis test to determine if the 2% difference in conversion rates is statistically significant. Outline the steps, including defining null and alternative hypotheses, choosing a significance level, selecting an appropriate test (e.g., chi-squared), and interpreting the p-value.

## 9. Model Deployment and Monitoring

I have a trained machine learning model for predicting fraudulent transactions. Outline the key considerations and steps involved in deploying this model into a production environment. Focus on aspects like API integration, scalability, latency, model versioning, and ongoing monitoring for performance decay and data drift.

## 10. Data Storytelling and Communication

Imagine you are presenting the results of a customer churn analysis to a non-technical executive board. The model shows a significant increase in churn among customers aged 18-25 who use a specific older version of our mobile app. Craft a concise, impactful summary of these findings, highlighting the business implications and suggesting actionable recommendations. Avoid technical jargon.
