    "\n",
    "## What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "Machine Learning (ML) is a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on teaching computers to **learn patterns from data** and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.  \n",
    "Instead of following fixed rules, ML models **improve their performance** as they are exposed to more data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:  \n",
    "- A spam filter learns to classify emails as \"spam\" or \"not spam\" by analyzing past labeled emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is an ML Model?\n",
    "An **ML model** is the mathematical representation of a real-world process learned from data.  \n",
    "It takes **inputs (features)** and produces **outputs (predictions/labels)**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input (Features):** Measurable properties or attributes (e.g., age, salary, exam scores).  \n",
    "- **Output (Label):** The target we want to predict (e.g., \"Will the person buy a product? Yes/No\").\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:  \n",
    "- In house price prediction:\n",
    "  - Features: size, location, number of rooms  \n",
    "  - Label: house price  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts in ML\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Features:** Independent variables used as input to the model.  \n",
    "   - Example: Age, height, weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Labels (Target):** What the model is trying to predict.  \n",
    "   - Example: Disease status (Yes/No).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Training Data:** Historical data used to teach the model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Testing Data:** New/unseen data to evaluate model performance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Overfitting:** When a model learns training data *too well*, including noise, and performs poorly on new data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Underfitting:** When a model is too simple and fails to capture patterns in the data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Evaluation Metrics:** Used to measure performance. Examples:\n",
    "   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, RMSE (for regression).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Procedure to Create a Machine Learning Model\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the Problem**\n",
    "   - Decide what you want to predict (classification, regression, clustering, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Collect Data**\n",
    "   - Gather relevant datasets for training and testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Preprocess Data**\n",
    "   - Clean missing values, encode categorical data, normalize/scale features.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Split Data**\n",
    "   - Train/Test split (commonly 80% training, 20% testing).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Choose a Model**\n",
    "   - Examples: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Train the Model**\n",
    "   - Feed training data to let the model learn patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Evaluate the Model**\n",
    "   - Test with unseen data, calculate metrics like accuracy or RMSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Tune & Improve**\n",
    "   - Adjust parameters (hyperparameter tuning), feature engineering, try different algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Deploy the Model**\n",
    "   - Use the trained model in real-world applications to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "ML = Teaching machines to learn from data.  \n",
    "ML Model = A function that maps input features â†’ predicted output.  \n",
