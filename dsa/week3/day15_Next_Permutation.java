// ğŸ§  Simple Explanation of the Steps:
// Step 1: Find the "breaking point"
// Go from right to left and find the first number that is smaller than its next number.

// This is the place where the current order can be made slightly bigger.

// If no such number is found, it means the array is in descending order â€” like [3,2,1].

// Step 2: Find the next bigger number
// From the right side, look for the smallest number that is just bigger than the number you found in Step 1.

// Then swap them.

// Step 3: Reverse the right side
// To get the next permutation (just slightly bigger), we need to make the right side as small as possible.

// That means reversing the part after the index we swapped.
