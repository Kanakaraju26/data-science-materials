    "🔹 <b>1. Null Hypothesis (H₀)</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "- It’s the default assumption — \"nothing interesting is happening.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example: “Men and women have the same average age in the dataset.”\n",
    "\n",
    "- You test against this assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 <b>2. Alternative Hypothesis (H₁ or Hₐ)</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The opposite of the null — \"something is happening.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example: “Men and women have different average ages in the dataset.”\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 <b>3. \"If the null were true...\"</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Means: “Let’s pretend the null hypothesis is correct and see how surprising our data is.”\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example: If we assume men and women have the same average age, what’s the probability we’d still see the age difference we observed in the sample?\n",
    "\n",
    "- That probability is the p-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 <b>4. False Positive (Type I Error)</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "- You say there is an effect/difference when in reality there isn’t.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example: You conclude \"men are older than women\" when in truth, there’s no real age difference — you were just fooled by random noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 <b>5. False Negative (Type II Error)</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "- You say there is no effect when there actually is one.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example: Men really are older than women in the population, but your test fails to detect it (maybe sample too small).\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 <b>6. True Positive</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "- You correctly detect an effect when it really exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example: You find a significant difference in average income between education levels, and the difference is real.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 7<b>. True Negative</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "- You correctly conclude “no effect” when in fact there is no effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example: You test whether income depends on race in your dataset, and find no difference — and in reality, there is none.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Null hypothesis = patient is healthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Alternative = patient is sick.\n",
    "\n",
    "- False Positive = test says sick, but actually healthy.\n",

    "- False Negative = test says healthy, but actually sick.\n",
