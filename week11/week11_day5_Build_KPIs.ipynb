    "# DAX Functions – Simple Notes\n",
    "## 1️⃣ SUM()\n",
    "\n",
    "- What it does: Adds up all the numbers in a column.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example: SUM(Sales[Sales]) → total sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simple analogy: Like adding all the money from each bill in your wallet.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2️⃣ CALCULATE()\n",
    "\n",
    "- What it does: Changes the “context” of a calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example: CALCULATE([Total Sales], FILTER(...)) → calculate sales but only for certain months, products, or regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simple analogy: “Calculate only for this specific condition.”\n",
    "\n",
    "- Think: CALCULATE = Apply a filter before calculating.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3️⃣ FILTER()\n",
    "\n",
    "- What it does: Creates a subset of data that meets a condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example: FILTER(ALL('Date'[Date]), 'Date'[Date] <= MAX('Date'[Date])) → all dates up to today.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simple analogy: “Pick only the rows that match my rule.”\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4️⃣ ALL()\n",
    "\n",
    "- What it does: Ignores filters on a column or table.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example: ALL('Date'[Date]) → consider all dates, even if a filter is applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simple analogy: “Look at the full picture, not just what’s selected.”\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5️⃣ PREVIOUSMONTH()\n",
    "\n",
    "- What it does: Returns the previous month based on a date column.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example: PREVIOUSMONTH('Date'[Date]) → last month’s dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simple analogy: “Go back one month.”\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6️⃣ DIVIDE()\n",
    "\n",
    "- What it does: Divides two numbers safely (avoids errors if denominator = 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example: DIVIDE([Total Sales] - Previous Month Sales, Previous Month Sales) → MoM % change.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simple analogy: “Divide A by B, and don’t break if B = 0.”\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Extra Note\n",
    "\n",
    "- DAX is mostly about logic, not memorizing syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you understand the purpose of each function, you can look up the exact syntax anytime.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Over time, using these functions in real projects will naturally make you remember them."
