    "# Day 17: YoY, MTD, YTD using DAX in Power BI\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîπ Objective\n",
    "Learn how to perform **time-based analysis** in Power BI using **Time Intelligence functions** in DAX. By the end of this session, you will be able to calculate:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **YoY (Year-over-Year) Sales**\n",
    "- **MTD (Month-to-Date) Sales**\n",
    "- **YTD (Year-to-Date) Sales**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîπ Dataset\n",
    "The dataset has the following relevant columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Order Date` (for time intelligence)\n",
    "- `Sales` (numeric measure to aggregate)\n",
    "- Other columns: Row ID, Order ID, Ship Date, Customer, Product, Region, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ This dataset is sufficient for today‚Äôs task.\n",

    "## üîπ Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. YoY (Year-over-Year)\n",
    "- Compares a measure with the same period in the previous year.\n",
    "- Useful for identifying growth or decline year-over-year.\n",
    "- DAX functions: `SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR`, `DATEADD`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. MTD (Month-to-Date)\n",
    "- Aggregates a measure from the start of the current month to the current date.\n",
    "- DAX function: `TOTALMTD([Measure], 'DateTable'[Date])`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. YTD (Year-to-Date)\n",
    "- Aggregates a measure from the start of the current year to the current date.\n",
    "- DAX function: `TOTALYTD([Measure], 'DateTable'[Date])`\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** These functions require a **proper Date Table**. Using only the `Order Date` column from the Sales table will not work reliably.\n",
